Datavaalit (“Data Elections Finland”) is a community-driven initiative
to crowd-source the collection and preprocessing of election and
decision-making data in Finland to support transparency, citizen
participation and data-driven journalism. During the municipal
elections in 2012, time series data on election statistics between
2004-2012 concerning 300 Finnish municipalities and over 20,000
candidates were collected and distributed through the datavaalit.fi
project site to be utilized by bloggers and journalists. In addition,
a social media feed aggregate was developed to follow the election
candidates in Twitter and Facebook. The project was established during
2012 and is in active development stage. This meetup is intended to
gather together interested parties to discuss and plan future
activities of the project in Finland as well as international
collaboration regarding European parliamentary elections in 2014.
